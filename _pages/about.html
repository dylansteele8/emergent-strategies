<h2>Alexandra Steele - Founder</h2>
<p>At Emergent Strategies LLC (formerly known as EcoMaven Associates), our goal is to help you create or evolve your business and marketing initiatives and build resiliency for ongoing success. Our founder, Alexandra Steele, has a proven track record in business development and marketing leadership across a range of industry sectors, from Wall Street financial services to Fortune 500 consumer goods and professional design/build services companies. She builds on that breadth of experience with her deep knowledge in sustainable business and green marketing practices.</p>
<p>Alex earned an undergraduate degree in Economics and received an MBA from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, where she discovered her passion and talent for marketing.</p>
<p>Born in Argentina and raised in the US, Alex is fluent in her native Spanish. In addition to her professional life, Alex enjoys the beauty of the Pacific Northwest while hiking, biking, and kayaking. When the weather calls for indoor activities, she enjoys reading fiction while drinking a double-tall Americano or dining out with friends savoring a full-bodied Malbec — one of Argentina’s finest exports.</p>
<p>Emergent Strategies supports business and community groups dedicated to innovation and progress. We work within a studio culture bringing a broad range of talented professionals together. We lead a team of collaborators that offer you a specific skillset based on your company's primary goals. Our fee structure is flexible. We can work on a project, contract or retainer fee basis.</p>
